# Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It describes the structure and content of a webpage using elements and tags.

## What is HTML?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's not a programming language, but rather a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the content on a webpage.

## Basic HTML Structure

Every HTML document follows a basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Key Components

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares this is an HTML5 document
- `<html>`: The root element that wraps all content
- `<head>`: Contains metadata about the document
- `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the webpage

## Your First HTML File

Create a file called `index.html` and add the basic structure above. Open it in your web browser to see your first webpage!

## Try It Yourself

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>About Me</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
    <p>My name is [Your Name] and I'm learning HTML!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Replace `[Your Name]` with your actual name and save the file. You've just created your first personalized webpage!
