# Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It describes the structure and content of a webpage using elements and tags.

## What is HTML?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's not a programming language, but rather a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the content on a webpage.

## Basic HTML Structure

Every HTML document follows a basic structure:

:::preview height="200px"

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

:::

## Key Components

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares this is an HTML5 document
- `<html>`: The root element that wraps all content
- `<head>`: Contains metadata about the document
- `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the webpage

## Your First HTML File

Create a file called `index.html` and add the basic structure above. Open it in your web browser to see your first webpage!

## Try It Yourself

:::preview height="200px"

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>About Me</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
    <p>My name is [Your Name] and I'm learning HTML!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

:::

Replace `[Your Name]` with your actual name and save the file. You've just created your first personalized webpage!

## Practice Exercise

Now it's your turn! Try creating your own HTML page with a heading and paragraph.

:::practice title="Create Your First HTML Page"
Create an HTML page with:
1. An h1 heading with your name
2. A paragraph describing what you want to learn
3. An h2 heading that says "My Goals"
4. Another paragraph with your learning goals

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>My Learning Journey</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Add your HTML here -->
    
  </body>
</html>
```
